# MVC
Model–view–controller (usually known as MVC) is a software design pattern[1] commonly used for developing user interfaces which divides the related program logic into three interconnected elements.

## Model
The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface.[5] It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application.

## View
Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

## Controller
Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

## What view engine should I use?
Although it chooses Jade by default if you don't specify a view option. Express itself can also support a large number of other templating languages (including EJS, Hbs, Pug (Jade), Twig, and Vash).

## What operating systems are supported?
Node can be run on Windows, macOS, many "flavours" of Linux, Docker, etc.
Express is run in a Node environment, and hence can run on any platform that runs Node.
